- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nachiket Prajapati
I am a dedicated Data Engineer with experience in designing and implementing data pipelines, cloud migrations, and scalable data solutions. I hold hands-on expertise in tools and technologies such as Azure Synapse Analytics, Databricks, SQL, and Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) logic. My work has spanned critical projects, including migrating on-premises databases to Azure SQL while ensuring data integrity, and building high-performance ETL pipelines using ADLS Gen 2 and Azure Data Factory.
My recent projects involved implementing SCD Type 1 and Type 2 to track historical changes and developing feature-rich, real-time analytics using cloud platforms. I excel in optimizing big data workflows, integrating structured and unstructured data sources, and ensuring compliance with governance standards. These projects have sharpened my skills in Python, Spark, and data warehousing architectures, making me proficient in delivering business insights through modern data solutions.
I am now seeking opportunities in data engineering roles where I can leverage my expertise in cloud platforms, big data tools, and scalable architecture design to build innovative solutions. I aim to contribute to impactful projects that drive data-driven decision-making in dynamic organizations.
